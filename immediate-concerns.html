    <div id="content"><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I'm always amazed at the confidence and certainty my young kids have in their answers to nearly all questions about their preferences. When asked which option they want, they very quickly choose and rarely waver in their choice.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I imagine I was that way too as a young child. Though over time, I've learned more sophisticated ways of thinking and decision making that I can run my consciousness through a process to come up with answers for harder questions. While these processes give more thoughtful answers, they are also slower and sometimes create additional emotional side effects.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"What if this answer isn't good enough?"</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Is there a backup in case this is wrong?"</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Does this align with my long term vision of X?"</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Do I really have to give up Y for this?"</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I suppose these are actually intended as inputs for learning how to better the decision making process in the future. But it sure feels a lot less simple than when I could just pick without having to think twice.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Maybe this is also a thing over-thinkers like me do â€“ turn one decision into improving decision making for the rest of time. It's fun to just think given the opportunity, despite it causing anguish.</span></p></div>
