    <div id="content"><p dir="ltr"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Toolbox Software</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The migration to software as a service happened to the entire stack of computing and its industry.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Your phone and computer offer periodic upgrades that add functionality but might also break the software that used to work on it. While those upgrades were free to you, the developers that maintain application software incur an expense to keep it updated and thus pass the cost back down to you, in the form of ads or a monthly subscription. Some software also has real-world cost per use, which also gets passed to you as with some margin on top for the developer. Developers are happy to be in this arrangement, as it provides long term opportunity to "provide value".</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This economic model aligns well for B2B markets. A business already thinks about cost at the monthly cadence, and a SaaS is just another line item on a list dominated by large numbers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">People don't think like this though. The only things with recurring cost we accept (begrudgingly at most) are expenses for necessity or habits – rent, phone bill, daycare, gym membership. Even a gym membership is not something most gym members get direct value out of; a gym's profitability predicates on most members not going frequently. It is arguable that the value of a gym membership is that it gives members the optionality of going, and that in itself is an aspirational and emotionally fulfilling to have. A gym membership is a feel good expense.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I find it hard for software to be a feel good expense, no matter its quality. With the exception of games, I think it's that we look at software as tools, like a hammer or a screwdriver, allowing us to extend ourselves to manipulate the world. We love tools – they make us more powerful and amplify what we are capable of. Tools should make us feel good – why doesn't software?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As a developer, there's a few pieces of developer-focused software I do find that make me feel good – vim, bash, ssh, etc. The thing common to these is that, once I've learned how to use them, they provide constant utility. Not only that, they change exceedingly infrequently in both quality, usage, and expected output. In my mind, these tools are predictable and something I can rely on for </span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">decades</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> to come, and I feel good because of that.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Like my wrench, these tools don't have a recurring expense that puts a floor to the economic barrier to entry for my continued amplified output. Like my drill bits, there are no corporate entities with enough power to single-handedly change how they work at will and cause them to break. I don't physically own these tools, but they hold properties that feel like ownership.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In consumer computing today, the recurring pricing model is not the only thing that prevents software from feeling like tools you can own. They can just stop working the way they used to, the way you've gotten used to. There's so many reasons for the latter, but it does not change our desire to own our tools.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We need more toolbox software that work can reliably for decades. This is really swimming up against the stream here. What needs to be true for this to happen?</span></p><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">...</span></p></div>
