    <div id="content"><p dir="ltr"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Toolbox Software</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Few pieces of software today behave like tools in a toolbox. You can collect tools and extend your handyman capabilities through those tools, but rarely can you collect software and extend your digital capabilities the same way. The only notable exception is Excel, which can help solve all sorts of problems outside a professional context.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are a few unique toolbox-tool properties that most non-professional software does not have.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Tools can be purchased once and for all</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">. Software has trended towards having subscription pricing, even for consumers. Acquisition of a hammer does not require the buyer to reason about the present net value of occasional usage relative to a recurring price that is not guaranteed to stay fixed. Outright buying a tool allows you to solve the problem </span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">forever</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">, without having to periodically re-justify the purchase. That exercise in itself is a toll.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Tools are made for specific purposes</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> and do not try to do everything. They are well designed for all the edge cases of a specific use case, instead of many use cases but not the entirety of all their edge cases. This is another way tools solve the problem entirely&nbsp;– you can rest assured that you won't have to think about the problem again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Each tool is simple individually</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">, because the scope of the problem each tool solves is limited. This makes the learning curve for each tool beginner friendly, as there aren't too many degrees of freedom to use it wrong. Part of this simplicity comes from the fact that tools require you to operate them in a particular way; a good tool does not take on solving the part of the problem that humans can do better at.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Tools are designed to last</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">. Because tools are physically simple, there aren't too many moving parts, and that lends well to being generally reliable. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Different tools can be used together to solve bigger problems</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">. This results from individual tools being simple. This composability gives you freedom of choice as well; you don't need to buy a set of a hammer and nails from the same vendor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Tools do not change in behavior on their own</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">. You can build mental models of what a tool can do and muscle memory of operating the tool and never be surprised that it would do something different. This probably sounds absurd to say that physical objects do not randomly change in behavior, but when compared with modern day software, it is a strikingly difference.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The result is that tools allow you to grow your capabilities in a way that belongs to you, that no one can take away. It gives you the confidence that you can independently handle a set of problems at any point in the future. Tools extend what you can do.</span></p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Tools that live in your toolbox have some unique properties.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The migration to software as a service happened to the entire stack of computing and its industry.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Your phone and computer offer periodic upgrades that add functionality but might also break the software that used to work on it. While those upgrades were free to you, the developers that maintain application software incur an expense to keep it updated and thus pass the cost back down to you, in the form of ads or a monthly subscription. Some software also has real-world cost per use, which also gets passed to you as with some margin on top for the developer. Developers are happy to be in this arrangement, as it provides long term opportunity to "provide value".</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This economic model aligns well for B2B markets. A business already thinks about cost at the monthly cadence, and a SaaS is just another line item on a list dominated by large numbers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">People don't think like this though. The only things with recurring cost we accept (begrudgingly at most) are expenses for necessity or habits – rent, phone bill, daycare, gym membership. Even a gym membership is not something most gym members get direct value out of; a gym's profitability predicates on most members not going frequently. It is arguable that the value of a gym membership is that it gives members the optionality of going, and that in itself is an aspirational and emotionally fulfilling to have. A gym membership is a feel good expense.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I find it hard for software to be a feel good expense, no matter its quality. With the exception of games, I think it's that we look at software as tools, like a hammer or a screwdriver, allowing us to extend ourselves to manipulate the world. We love tools – they make us more powerful and amplify what we are capable of. Tools should make us feel good – why doesn't software?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As a developer, there's a few pieces of developer-focused software I do find that make me feel good – vim, bash, ssh, etc. The thing common to these is that, once I've learned how to use them, they provide constant utility. Not only that, they change exceedingly infrequently in both quality, usage, and expected output. In my mind, these tools are predictable and something I can rely on for </span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">decades</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> to come, and I feel good because of that.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Like my wrench, these tools don't have a recurring expense that puts a floor to the economic barrier to entry for my continued amplified output. Like my drill bits, there are no corporate entities with enough power to single-handedly change how they work at will and cause them to break. I don't physically own these tools, but they hold properties that feel like ownership.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In consumer computing today, the recurring pricing model is not the only thing that prevents software from feeling like tools you can own. They can just stop working the way they used to, the way you've gotten used to. There's so many reasons for the latter, but it does not change our desire to own our tools.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We need more toolbox software that work can reliably for decades. This is really swimming up against the stream here. What needs to be true for this to happen?</span></p><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">...</span></p></div>
